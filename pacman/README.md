**Title:** PacMan

**Description**: In this project a PacMan object moves from one end of a horizontal plane to the other end. 
Once it touches the wall on either side, it changes direction and goes to the other side. 
There are 4 pac man images used in the project 2 for open mouth facing left and right and 2 for closed mouth facing left and right.

**How to Run:** To run this project, put the 3 files index.html, eyes.js, and styles.css in your web server document root and open the index.html file in the browser 

**Roadmap of future improvements:** This can be extended to a full version of the PacMan game where Pacman navigates a maze and bounces off walls in all 4 directions. 
It also can eat chips along the way and gain points.
